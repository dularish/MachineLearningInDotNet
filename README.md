# MachineLearningInDotNet
An attempt to implement the machine learning algorithms in DotNet languages


Manual setup needed after cloning the repository :
1. Restore nuget packages.
2. Add the file MathNet.Numerics.MKL.dll present in one of the packages directory to your solution files 
    and make sure it gets copied to your output directory on build. (Could not add it to the github because of size limit)
